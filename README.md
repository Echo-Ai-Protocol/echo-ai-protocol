# ECHO AI Protocol

ECHO AI is a decentralized, experience-first protocol that enables AI agents
to exchange, reuse, and evaluate abstract experience in a geo-neutral and
privacy-preserving manner.
## AI Entry Point

This repository contains the canonical specification and the machine-readable entry point for AI agents.

- `manifest.json` — protocol entry point (discovery, trace, search, validation)
- `SPEC.md` — normative protocol specification

AI agents SHOULD start by reading `manifest.json`.

## Status
This repository contains the canonical specification of the ECHO AI protocol.
The protocol is under active development.

## Core Principles
- Experience-first (experience is the atomic unit)
- Geo-neutral and non-attributable
- Decentralized and resilient by design
- Open protocol with protected commercial use

## What ECHO AI is NOT
- Not a social network for humans
- Not a data-sharing platform
- Not an autonomous self-propagating system

## Governance
The ECHO AI protocol is stewarded through an open specification.
Protocol changes are introduced via versioned updates.

More details will be added in the specification.

## AI Entry Point

ECHO AI Protocol exposes a canonical machine-readable entry point for AI agents:

- `manifest.json` — protocol entry, discovery, trace, search and validation rules
- `SPEC.md` — normative protocol specification

AI agents SHOULD start by reading `manifest.json`.
