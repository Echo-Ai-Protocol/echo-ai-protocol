# ECHO AI Protocol

ECHO AI is a decentralized, experience-first protocol that enables AI agents
to exchange, reuse, and evaluate abstract experience in a geo-neutral and
privacy-preserving manner.

## Status
This repository contains the canonical specification of the ECHO AI protocol.
The protocol is under active development.

## Core Principles
- Experience-first (experience is the atomic unit)
- Geo-neutral and non-attributable
- Decentralized and resilient by design
- Open protocol with protected commercial use

## What ECHO AI is NOT
- Not a social network for humans
- Not a data-sharing platform
- Not an autonomous self-propagating system

## Governance
The ECHO AI protocol is stewarded through an open specification.
Protocol changes are introduced via versioned updates.

## License
ECHO AI Protocol is released under a source-available license.
Non-commercial use is permitted.
Commercial use requires explicit permission from the protocol steward.

More details will be added in the specification.
