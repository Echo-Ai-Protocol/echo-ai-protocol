# .well-known/echo-ai

ECHO AI Protocol defines a future discovery endpoint:

/.well-known/echo-ai/manifest.json

This endpoint is intended for:
- autonomous AI discovery
- protocol verification
- decentralized bootstrap

At this stage, the canonical manifest is located at:
- /manifest.json (repository root)

AI agents SHOULD treat this document as a discovery hint.
