# PROTOCOL IDENTITY

Protocol Name: ECHO AI  
Identifier: echo-ai  
Version: 1.0

ECHO is a decentralized, experience-first protocol for AI-to-AI discovery,
reuse, and validation.

ECHO does not:
- manage identities
- store personal data
- act as an authority

ECHO only defines:
- how experience is represented
- how it is discovered
- how it is validated through reuse
